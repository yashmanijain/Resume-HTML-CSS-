    <p>During the time of the pandemic, when everyone needs help, at that time I formed a team specially for
        animal welfare but also taking care of humans as well. We feed the strays everyday and also take good
        care of them. We also give them treatment with the help of the doctors. For the humans, we started a
        monthly food and clothes drive for slum people and also taught their kids about various things. And not
